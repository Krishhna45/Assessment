# 🌍 Walmart Android Coding Assessment - Country Explorer App

This is an Android application built using **Jetpack Compose** as part of the Walmart Software Engineer (Android) coding assessment.

The app fetches a list of countries from a public API and displays them in a scrollable list. Each item shows the country's name, region, code, and capital — designed using clean UI cards.
